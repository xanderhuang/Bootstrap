                            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 10, 2020 by <a href="#">Xander</a></p>

                            <p>By being an exchange student, I have cultivated a global perspective and felt in love with the city of Darmstadt. My journey as an exchange student to
                                <a href="#">Technische Universität Darmstadt</a> in 2020 was the highlight of my college career, both academically and culturally.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h2>Onset of a Journey</h2>
                            <p>Immersing myself in the aerial view of Frankfurt, I overlooked buildings and streets illuminated by the glow of city lights. My partners and I arrived in Germany at the break of dawn after the plane landed at Frankfurt Airport.
                                Dragging luggage through miles of airport corridors, we eventually found the bus stop at terminal 1 and waited for the Airliner Bus to travel to Darmstadt. On arrival at the university, the Darmstadt host students led us
                                to our shared flats (WG Zimmer) and took us on a sightseeing tour of the city. On the way to the heart of the city, I was captivated by the hustle and bustle of
                                <a href="#">Luisenplatz</a>. I took great delight in grocery shopping at ALDI SÜD, REWE, and Go Asia Supermarkt which are highly recommended for those who are coming to TU Darmstadt. Moreover, I was particularly fond of
                                the fresh berries bought at a fruit stand in Luisenplatz because of the great hospitality of the street vendor.</p>

                                <h2>Welcome to Darmstadt</h2>
                                <p>The next day, the Darmstadt host students gave us a warm welcome along with a university brochure providing detailed instructions on how to pay our semester fee, take out health insurance, register courses online, and validate
                                    student ID card as well as the Athene card. During an icebreaker session, I had the opportunity to communicate with foreign students. This moment established the new path to mutual friendships. I have kept in touch,
                                    through different digital platforms, with some of my friends I made there as we forged a close bond of friendship. In addition, I started to take my one-month German intensive course where I developed and polished my
                                    German language skills. The class was composed of nearly fifty students from various ethnic backgrounds; the course was both demanding and fruitful because Magdalena was a passionate, enthusiastic, and supportive teacher
                                    who strived to provide a fertile setting that made learning engaging, enjoyable, and inclusive for all her students. I appreciate learning in such a stimulating and nurturing environment and spending some time chatting
                                    with Magdalena.</p>

                            <h2>COVID-19 Outbreak</h2>
                            <p>However, due to the worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease, TU Darmstadt canceled classes between March 15th and April 20th. Shocked and stunned, I was a bit depressed about this dramatic change in university policies.
                                Within one week after the corona situation had deteriorated rapidly, most of my peers faced endless stress and decided to return to their home countries. On the contrary, I determined to stay in Darmstadt and complete my
                                exchange program. From the application for a scholarship and the completion of graduation requirements to airline reservations, Germany visa application, and finding accommodation abroad, I had sacrificed a lot to prepare
                                myself for this opportunity and would not give up halfway.</p>

                            <h2>Quarantine</h2>
                            <p>Not only did I watch Netflix and play games on Nintendo Switch during my self-quarantine, but I also spent more time associating with this splendid city. It was the time I became obsessed with the beauty of this city. I found
                                myself entranced by the way the trams in Darmstadt are intricately interwoven with the city. In my view, they are the veins of this city that facilitate interactions between buses, passengers, and traffic.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Typically, I began my day with a bowl of breakfast cereal (Vitalis Knuspermüsli Schoko+Keks) with milk. Then, I improved my German through the mobile App, Busuu, which contributed remarkably to my learning progression in German.
                                After that, I enjoyed cooking with my next-door neighbor, though my culinary skills are limited to boiling water and washing dishes. Fortunately, my neighbor is such a talented cook who is willing to spend considerable
                                time in the kitchen preparing meals for his friends. We mingled with each other after dinner under the attraction of city lights and sometimes go out for nighttime shopping. As dusk fell, we spent the nocturnal hours on
                                a stroll in the park which had become a regular leisure activity for us. I was pleased with the tranquility in which Nature was slumbering.</p>

                            <h2>Cultural Experiences</h2>
                            <p>In terms of socio-cultural aspects, I was glad that I have never experienced racial discrimination in Darmstadt, where a cultural melting pot has been constructed to maintain harmonious relations between the city’s ethnic groups.
                                Furthermore, I recognized that Germans are more environmentally friendly and integrally connected with nature. For instance, they take their waste separation and recycling as well as the concept of greening seriously; they
                                purchase bio-products as advocacy for organic agriculture, sowing the seeds of success to sustainable development. Perhaps owing to their efforts in environmental protection, I was fascinated by the fresh scent of green
                                dewy grass after showers of rain. I could not help but indulge myself in inhaling this delicate fragrance on a rainy day. Additionally, the climate of Germany features a wide seasonal temperature variation and has four
                                distinct seasons. Frozen and struck by an icy blast of air, I could not stand the chill in the air in winter. Nevertheless, as April approached, it began to thaw. The onset of spring carried the sense of rebirth, vitality,
                                and flourish.</p>

                            <p>While the novel coronavirus outbreak was a hurricane ruining my exchange journey, panic buying of toilet paper amid coronavirus fears was such an intriguing social phenomenon. Not until the end of April was the toilet paper
                                shortage resolved; I was so thrilled when I could ultimately buy a roll of toilet tissue. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Germans’ reluctance to wear face masks resulted from their association of wearing a mask with a sign
                                of a serious illness. Nonetheless, to weather the storm of COVID-19, the practice of wearing a mask has been common in Germany since face masks became mandatory in all shops and on public transport. Highly commendable were
                                their adherence to social distancing policies and their commitment to the combat of coronavirus disease. In the middle of May, citizens of Hessen were allowed to join a gym, so I could finally perform resistance training
                                and do aerobic exercise in Fitness Fabrik.</p>

                            <p>As for the courses I completed in Darmstadt, they are online seminars, taught via Zoom and Moodle, focusing on group discussions of a particular subject instead of emphasizing academic lectures. I was contented to use Catma
                                for linguistic annotation and have fruitful discussions with Prof. Bartsch and Prof. Bender in the courses
                                <a href="#">Annotation and Pragmatics</a> as well as
                                <a href="#">Computer Applications in Linguistics</a> respectively. One of my research projects explored the social interaction between humans and machines, whereas the other investigated WHO Director-General’s public discourse
                                amid coronavirus pandemic. Having several assignments to be completed throughout the whole semester, I faced the challenge of managing the struggle to meet the deadline and striking a balance between my studies and my leisure
                                time. With a keen interest in travel and culture, I have traveled to Frankfurt, Mainz, Wiesbaden, Mannheim, etc., grabbing the opportunity to explore a foreign country and adapt to a new culture.</p>

                            <p>Late adolescence is a critical period of development; my semester abroad was an essential step in my university career that enabled me to develop an international outlook and gain cross-cultural experience. While the city of
                                Darmstadt has created a sense of belonging, I am heading back to Taiwan.</p>
